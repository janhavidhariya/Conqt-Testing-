It assumes that no user or device should be trusted, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. Zero Trust replaces the traditional perimeter-based security model with a more granular, identity-based approach that requires users and devices to be authenticated and authorized before gaining access to company resources. It involves continuous monitoring of all network activity to detect and respond to potential security threats.

Access controls: Access controls limit access to sensitive data to authorized users or groups. Authentication: Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, using a password, biometric, or two-factor authentication. Data masking: Data masking is a process of replacing real data with fictitious data to protect the original data from being accessed by unauthorized users. Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP tools prevent sensitive data from being accidentally or intentionally leaked, by monitoring and controlling data movement. Auditing and logging: Auditing and logging monitor user activity to detect suspicious behavior or unauthorized access to sensitive data. Secure file transfer: Secure file transfer tools use encryption to securely transfer files and data between different locations. Vulnerability scanning: Vulnerability scanning tools scan for known vulnerabilities in systems and applications, allowing them to be patched before they are exploited. Real-time monitoring: Real-time monitoring tools watch for unusual or suspicious behavior, such as repeated login attempts, that may indicate a security breach. Compliance reporting: Compliance reporting tools generate reports that help organizations comply with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, or PCI-DSS.</span></p>","specifications":"<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Here are some common specifications of Data Security software: Compatibility: The software should be compatible with various operating systems and platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and cloud-based environments.
